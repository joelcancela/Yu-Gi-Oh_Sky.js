Yu-Gi-Oh_Sky.js is a JS script used to display the Yu-Gi-Oh! cards that I own listed on a MySQL database.

* Sort cards by name, ATK, DEF, level, quantity owned, card type
* Filter cards by card type (monster, spell, trap), monster types, family, ATK, DEF, level, quantity and property
* See the description of a card (in french)
